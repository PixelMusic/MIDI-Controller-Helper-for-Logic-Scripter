# MIDI-Controller-Helper-for-Logic-Scripter

This respository contains Logic Scripter code for a MIDI Controller Helper. 
This is a tool to modify midi CC messages to a Plugin in Logic. 
It's designed so the buttons on a MIDI controller can modify what the controls do. 
It's also more convient and extensive than Logic's smart controls and built in controller mapping.
It's also a convient way to save a controller mapping for plugins that don't provide CC mapping.

I've created custom mappings for Plugins and reference guides. 
I'll also create different setups for different midi controllers.

The standard setup is based around a KORG nanoKONTROL Studio with 8 faders and 8 knobs. 
Most functionality just needs 1 or 2 set of buttons. But more of the complicated plugin setups can use all all the buttons.

Thanks to Philip Regan's book The Complete Guide to Logic Pro's Scripter. The book was a great resource for getting started
and understanding getting the PluginParameters working.
