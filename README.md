# MIDI-Controller-Helper-for-Logic-Scripter

This respository contains Logic Scripter code for a MIDI Controller Helper. 
This is a tool to modify midi CC messages to a Plugin in Logic. 
It's designed so the buttons on a MIDI controller can modify what the controls do. 
It's also more convient and extensive than Logic's smart controls and built in controller mapping.
It's also a convient way to save a controller mapping for plugins that don't provide CC mapping.

This is designed around the KORG nanoKONTROL2 with 8 Knobs, 8 Faders 8 Solo, 8 Mute and 8 Record buttons. 
A 4th set of buttons are available as Select buttons, I have 6 of these setup on the transport controls.

Thanks to Philip Regan's book The Complete Guide to Logic Pro's Scripter. The book was a great resource for getting started
and understanding getting the PluginParameters working.
